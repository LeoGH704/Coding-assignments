TASK: A software company sells two products - Productivity and Efficiency.
Productivity sells for $110 and Efficiency sells for $180.
Quantity discounts for Productivity are as follows:
10 - 19 : 10%
20 - 49: 20%
50+ : 35%
Quantity discounts for Efficiency are as follows:
10 - 29 : 15%
30 - 39: 20%
40+ : 35%

Write a program that asks the user which package they would like to purchase, 
and the quantity that they would like to purchase. 
The program should then display to the user the discount applicable (if any), 
and the final cost of their purchase.

You should also develop and submit the pseudocode OR flowchart for this program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART ONE-Pseudocode
1)	 Ask the user what they would like to buy
2)	 If the answer is Package, then we can move on to the next step
3)	 Next the program will display the package quantities: Productivity sells for 110 and           efficiency sells at 180
4)	 The next question pops up and asks which quality they would want:
5)	 If the user enters productivity 
6)	 The question that comes up is the items they desire to purchase.
7)	 If the user enters a number from 1-9 they do not qualify for a discount
8)	 If the user enters a number from 10-19 they qualify for 10 % discount
9)	 If the user enters a number from 20-49 they qualify for 20 % discount
10)	If the user enters a number from 50-60 they qualify for a 35% discount
11)	Next it will compute the cost: productivity(110)*the discount(depends the item#)
12)	The final cost is: cost minus the discount (please see line 44-61 in screenshot)
13)	Then the final cost will be displayed 
14)	If the user enters efficiency 
15)	The question that comes up is the items they desire to purchase.
16)	If the user enters a number from 1-9 they do not qualify for a discount
17)	If the user enters a number from 10-29 they qualify for 15 % discount
18)	If the user enters a number from 30-39 they qualify for 20 % discount
19)	If the user enters a number from 40-50 they qualify for 35 % discount
20)	Next it will compute the cost: efficiency(180)*the discount(depends the item#)
21)	The final cost is: cost minus the discount (please see line 44-61 in screenshot)
22)	Then the final cost will be displayed
23)	If the user doesn’t enter productivity or efficiency the program stops and tells them “ your answer is not productivity or efficiency” 
24)	If the user enters another word that is not package. The program stops and tells them “your answer is not package”

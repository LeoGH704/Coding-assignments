ASSIGNMENT: Write a program that asks the user to enter the cost of an iPhone 12. 
The program should then calculate the dollar amount of tax due on that cost (The tax rate is 11.5%), 
and then display the total cost (Cost + Tax) to the user.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
iphoneprice = float(input("Enter I-Phone 12 price: "))
#this is the part where the user enters the iphone 21 amount. 
#I use a float so the user can enter either a number without decimal 
#or a number with a decimal.

salestax = 0.115
#This is the sales tax for the purchase.


total = salestax * iphoneprice
#this is the where i mulitply the sales tax with the iphone price. 


print ("Your total amount is: ", total + iphoneprice)
#this will result in "you total amount is". 
#then the total of the calculated product total addded to the iphone price


#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#this section is to break down what i did for the user 

print ("Iphone Price: ",iphoneprice)
#this will  print "iphone price" which means the price selected

print ("Tax: ", salestax)
#this will print "tax" which is the tax 11.5% or 0.115

print (iphoneprice, "x", salestax, "=", total + iphoneprice)
#this will print the iphone price times (x) the sales tax. 
#then the total amount added to the iphone price
